* *Clean code is code that has been taken care of. Someone has taken the time to keep it simple and orderly. They have paid appropriate attention to details. They have cared.* — Robert C. Martin 
* *If you want your code to be easy to write, make it easy to read.* — Robert C. Martin
* *Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares. There is nothing obvious you can do to make it better.* — Michael Feathers
* *Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose. Clean code never obscures the designers’ intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control.* — Grady Booch
* *Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.* — Martin Fowler
